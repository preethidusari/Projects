            What kinds of questions can I ask?
          </AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
            You can ask about anything related to your legal situation, such as
            questions about a specific process, documents or forms related to
            your legal matter, or about the meaning of specific terms or
            phrases. You can ask for advice, strategic coaching, or insight into
            possible outcomes. Advice sessions and document review services are
            also a good way to get a second opinion about your legal issue.
